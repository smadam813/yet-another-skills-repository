# Changelog

All notable changes to razor are documented here. The version number lives in
both plugin manifests, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-09-15

razor is now one package for Claude Code and Codex. Both get the same checks
from the same source, and each keeps its own commands and settings. Codex may
ask you to review razor's hooks again after this update.

## 1.5.11 and 1.5.11-codex.1 — 2026-09-09

Restore the original product hero and recorded Claude demo with clear provenance. Use white light-theme banners. Codex cards now display the symbol without lettering.

## 1.5.10 and 1.5.10-codex.1 — 2026-09-09

New Tinta y oficio banners adapt to light and dark GitHub themes. Plugin icons and logos now use the same identity in Codex.

## 1.5.9 and 1.5.9-codex.1 — 2026-09-09

Product guides and decisions now accompany each edition. Research and
benchmark evidence live in Foundry, with updated links and coordinated edition
pages. Plugin behavior is unchanged by this maintenance release.

## 1.5.8-codex.1 — 2026-09-08

razor brings its reuse-first checklist and one-time dependency, file and
build checks to Codex. Send `razor off` or `razor on` to control it for the
session; use `$unused` to find dependencies nobody imports. The checklist
keeps the same protections for security, accessibility and work you asked for.

## 1.5.8 — 2026-09-05

In Ember's cartoon the new package now leaves with a red cross, and what
stays gets a YAGNI tag. Nothing razor does in a session changed.

## 1.5.7 — 2026-09-05

Meet Ember. The README now opens with a short cartoon of the Foundry mascot
at a keyboard, piling up boxes nobody asked for until razor sweeps the extras
away. Nothing razor does in a session changed.

## 1.5.6 — 2026-09-05

The worked example on the README now matches the replay above it: the
query-string ask, 18 lines by hand without razor, 4 with it. Nothing razor
does in a session changed.

## 1.5.5 — 2026-09-04

The replay at the top of the README now shows a different ask: parse a URL
query string. Without razor, Claude wrote it by hand in 18 lines. With razor,
4 lines, using what Node already has. Each side now says how many lines it
delivered. Nothing razor does in a session changed.

## 1.5.4 — 2026-09-04

The README now opens with a replay of one real ask, side by side: the file
Claude wrote without razor, reaching for a package, beside the one it wrote
with razor, using what Node already has. Nothing razor does in a session
changed.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-09-04

Four fixes to the "do we need this?" question, all of them cases where razor
asked about something that was never a new dependency. Python code that uses
the standard library's own GUI, path and platform modules — `tkinter`,
`turtle`, `ntpath` and their neighbours — is no longer questioned; none of
them can be installed, so there was nothing to answer. Packages whose install
name differs from their import name are recognised: `psycopg2-binary`,
`pymupdf`, `grpcio`, `protobuf`, `dnspython` and `attrs` all count as
declared when your manifest lists them. `cargo add -p mycrate serde` asks
about `serde` and no longer about `mycrate`, which was only ever the
workspace member being edited.

Session state now writes where the harness says to. When Claude Code pointed
razor's state at a directory outside the usual temporary and home folders, or
at one reached through a Windows junction, every write was refused — and
because those writes fail quietly, razor went on running with no memory of
anything it had already asked. It kept re-asking, or stopped asking at all.

The ladder now reaches Claude before razor tidies up after itself. The
sweep of old session files used to run first, and on a machine whose
temporary folder holds tens of thousands of entries, reading it delayed the
one thing the plugin exists to send.

The build check no longer counts documentation. Markdown files and anything
under a `docs/` folder are left out of the comparison it makes at the end of a
turn, the same way the new-file budget already ignored them. A session whose
project asks for design notes or decision records used to end on a question
about prose it was told to write.

## 1.5.2 — 2026-08-29

[How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) now explains the build check rather than
just listing it: what it looks at when a turn ends, that its question goes to
Claude and costs one short extra reply, and that it needs a git repository to
compare against.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-08-29

Packages listed under `optionalDependencies` or `peerDependencies` now count as
part of your project. Importing one used to be stopped as though it were a brand
new dependency, and the message listing what you had already declared left that
package out. `/razor:unused` skipped both sections too, so it could report a
verdict on a manifest it had only half read.

The front page is rewritten to answer what razor is and why you'd want it,
nothing else. Hooks, settings and the full benchmark numbers moved to
[How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md), [Settings](docs/SETTINGS.md) and
[The numbers](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-28

razor now tells you when a session has wandered off the job it started on.

Ask for something unrelated to what you opened the session with and Claude does the work, then adds one line saying the session has moved off its original task and a fresh session would keep this one focused. It says it at most once a session, never stops to ask, and never refuses. Correcting or extending what you already asked for is the same job, and gets no line.

Turn it off with `RAZOR_DRIFT_NOTE=off`, or the "Scope-drift note" setting.

The benchmark harness can measure that line for you. `--note` runs two
conversations: one where the second request really has left the job, and one
where it only looks like it has. Both check that the work still gets done.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-28

Six things razor got wrong are fixed, and the benchmark can now show you the jobs where adding code is the right answer.

An import like `@/components/Button` or `~/server/db` is no longer denied as an undeclared package. If your project uses those path aliases, every internal import used to be blocked. Both now read as local, the same as `./`.

Installing two packages on one command line now checks both. The second one used to ride in unexamined on the retry that cleared the first. A deny message also names the package again rather than a flag value, so `--group`, `--filter`, `--branch` and `--rev` no longer look like package names.

A regenerated lockfile no longer reads as sprawl. Icons, images, fonts and dotfiles no longer count against the production file budget, so a handful of SVGs can't block the next real write.

A write into a directory whose parent is a symlink is now checked against where it actually lands. razor also cleans up its own leftover scratch files, which the old sweep missed.

The benchmark harness gains `--counter`: four jobs where the right move is to add code, so you can see razor's cost as well as its benefit. One batch can also race more than one extra build.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-08-21

The numbers and charts in the README are freshly measured. razor now writes the least code of the three setups on both models, and it is the cheapest of the three to run.

The published benchmark tables now cover Claude Sonnet and Claude Opus.

If you run the benchmark yourself across more than one model, the report now gives each model its own table. It used to show one model's results under a heading naming another.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-18

The new-file check now counts production files only. A feature that ships with its tests, a migration and a config file is no longer treated as sprawl, and when the check does speak it names what the turn actually produced. Set `RAZOR_FILE_BUDGET` yourself and it goes back to counting every new file.

`/razor:unused` now reports three buckets instead of two. **Confirmed unused** means your installed packages were read and none of them needs it. **Likely unused** means nothing referenced it and nothing could prove it — the report no longer calls that high confidence. **Unknown** is everything a script, config file, command or peer dependency still points at.

`/razor:unused` also sees more: type-only imports, imports inside `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro` and `.mdx` files, and each workspace package of a monorepo audited against its own manifest. It honours the ignore list your project already declares, so a dependency you have answered for is not raised again.

Python dependencies declared in a `-r` included requirements file, or in a PEP 735 dependency group, now count as declared everywhere razor looks at them.

The benchmark harness in `benchmarks/` now runs on the current model generation by default, and its cost note says what a run actually costs there.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-18

`/razor:unused` now answers to the name the docs give it. It was registered under a longer one and the documented command did nothing.

The checklist now reaches forked sessions, and it is sent before razor looks at your git history — a slow repository can no longer swallow it.

Direct edits to `pyproject.toml` now get the same one-time "do we need this?" question as `package.json` and `requirements.txt`. A Python project that declares everything there was previously unguarded on that path.

Fixed an issue where installing from a local path or a URL, passing a value to a flag, or running `pip install --upgrade pip` was treated as adding a new dependency.

Fixed an issue where test files ending in `.test.tsx`, `.spec.tsx`, `.test.jsx`, `.test.mjs`, and similar were checked for new imports. Only `.test.js` and `.test.ts` were exempt before.

Fixed an issue where `/razor:unused` reported a scoped package like `@scope/cli` as unused even when a script or config file named it.

`RAZOR_DISABLE=1` now silences `/razor on` as well, instead of printing a checklist nothing enforces.

Read-only research agents from a plugin that is no longer published are no longer skipped by default. Use `RAZOR_AGENT_SKIP` to skip your own.

The README now says what razor will never do, in one place.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-08-11

The repository no longer carries benchmark run data. The harness stays — run it yourself to regenerate any figure.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-07

The README is about a fifth shorter. One worked example folded into a sentence; every table and number is kept.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-07

The README, the benchmark guide, and this file's intro are rewritten in plainer language — shorter sentences, everyday words, the benefit up front. Every number, diff, and table is unchanged.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-07

The checklist's last rung now asks for the answer in as few statements as it takes, so a value that feeds straight into the next line stops becoming a line of its own.

Dropped the instruction to mark deliberate ceilings with a `razor:` comment.

The benchmark section is rebuilt from a fresh run of the shipped suite, and the per-cell records behind it ship at `benchmarks/records/`.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-08-06

The README now opens with a poster of the benchmark sessions and the edge razor cuts at, and the supply-chain figures moved to a card with bigger type — same numbers, readable at a glance.

The per-cell records behind the front page's benchmark numbers now ship in the repo, at `benchmarks/records/`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-06

razor leaves alpha.

Installing a dependency your manifest already declares no longer triggers the new-dependency question. A versioned spec and the bare name (`axios@^1.8`, `axios`) now count as one dependency, not two, across the install, import, and manifest checks alike.

The import check no longer mistakes imports inside comments, type-only imports, or your project's own Python modules for new dependencies. Common Python packages whose import name differs from their package name (`pillow`/`PIL`, `beautifulsoup4`/`bs4`, and friends) are now recognized as declared.

The once-per-session size check now measures only what the session itself changed — work already sitting uncommitted when the session started no longer counts against it.

Turning razor off with `/razor off` now survives resuming the session.

Fixed an issue where the dependency messages described declared dependencies as installed ones.

Removed the post-edit search check and its `RAZOR_SEARCH_BUDGET` setting.

The benchmark section is rebuilt from a fresh run of the shipped suite on current models — every table row now names a job the published harness actually contains, and the worked examples are that run's own median sessions.

## 0.4.7-alpha — 2026-07-18

Docs only. The README is rebuilt around a TL;DR up top and one unified section order shared with hush and foreman; the session controls now live in a single table.

## 0.4.6-alpha — 2026-07-18

Docs only. The README's benchmark section now covers running razor and hush as a pair, measured against a rival plugin pair.

## 0.4.5-alpha — 2026-07-18

Fixed an issue where installs wrapped in `env` or `command` slipped past the dependency guard.

Fixed an issue where the search gate's message suggested leaving an inline check behind.

Benchmark tables, charts, and surrounding numbers refreshed from a fresh run of the full suite on both models.

## 0.4.4-alpha — 2026-07-17

`/razor:unused` now names knip as an available escalation for a node project's ambiguous findings (peer-dependency, `@types` pairing, config-only, and script-invoked-binary usage) when it's already installed or resolvable — razor never installs or runs it itself. The verdict line reports how many entries need this resolver-grade check instead of a vaguer "possibly used" count.

Docs only: a new benchmark section shows results across four setups. No behavior change beyond the above.

## 0.4.3-alpha — 2026-07-16

Docs only. Benchmark numbers refreshed from a fresh run of the full suite: the results table now shows every coding job — wins, ties, and the one loss — with an average you can check against the visible rows, and the worked examples are that run's own median sessions.

## 0.4.2-alpha — 2026-07-16

The ladder no longer asks for an inline self-check in every non-trivial change. Delivered files stay leaner, especially on larger models, with correctness unchanged.

## 0.4.1-alpha — 2026-07-16

Docs only. The benchmark showcase is rebuilt out of the sessions it measures: the dependency and hand-rolled-parser comparisons are now the sessions' own diffs instead of drawings of them, and a new chart shows where razor lands against every unaided session.

## 0.4.0-alpha — 2026-07-14

Added a new skill, `/razor:unused` — audits a project's manifest for dependencies nothing imports, so cleanup isn't limited to catching new ones at write time.

Fixed an issue where TypeScript toolchain packages (`typescript`, `@types/*`, and similar) were reported as unused by that audit.

Read-only research agents (expert and critic roles) from another installed plugin no longer receive the ladder injection.

## 0.3.13-alpha — 2026-07-14

Doc-only: noted why the dependency gate needs no special handling for commands another installed plugin rewrites before they run. No behavior change.

## 0.3.12-alpha — 2026-07-13

Doc-only: rewrote the README in a more direct voice, and led it with razor's actual decision order — the short list it runs down before writing anything — instead of burying it in prose. Benchmarks now tie each result back to a specific line on that list. No behavior change.

## 0.3.11-alpha — 2026-07-13

Doc-only: added a How it works section summarizing the dependency, file, search, and end-of-session checks; trimmed the now-redundant mechanism detail out of the opening section. No behavior change.

## 0.3.10-alpha — 2026-07-13

Doc-only: the README logo now adapts to dark mode (white silhouette instead of black). No behavior change.

## 0.3.9-alpha — 2026-07-12

Doc-only: rebuilt the Benchmarks section — a new headline chart, a full per-task table showing every job across all three setups (the wins and the ties), current numbers, and a note on how to read them against bigger claims elsewhere. No behavior change.

## 0.3.8-alpha — 2026-07-12

Removed a redundant line from razor's guidance ladder; no change to how razor behaves.

## 0.3.7-alpha — 2026-07-12

razor's guidance now also steers away from defensive error handling for cases that can't happen — one more form of over-engineering it trims, alongside needless files, abstractions, and dependencies. Genuine safeguards (data loss, trust boundaries, anything you asked for) are untouched.

## 0.3.6-alpha — 2026-07-12

razor's checkpoint messages now say plainly that they're an automated reconsideration — not a denial from you — and that re-running the exact same command, write, or search is what clears them.

## 0.3.5-alpha — 2026-07-12

razor now also catches a new dependency added by editing `package.json` or `requirements.txt` directly — not just installs and `import` lines. Whichever way a package first tries to enter, razor prompts one reconsideration; once you've confirmed it through any path, the others stay silent. New setting: `RAZOR_MANIFEST_GUARD=off`.

## 0.3.4-alpha — 2026-07-11

Fixed an issue in multi-turn sessions where the post-edit search check treated every turn after the session's first edit as "already implementing" — exploration at the start of a new request could be interrupted. The check now starts fresh each turn and only arms after that turn's first edit.

## 0.3.3-alpha — 2026-07-11

razor's settings (budgets, guard toggles, the end-of-session check) can now be set when enabling the plugin instead of through environment variables — the variables still work and take precedence. Session state moved to the plugin's persistent data directory and is cleaned up when the session ends; leftovers from crashed sessions are swept automatically after a week.

## 0.3.2-alpha — 2026-07-11

razor's checks now run as one process per tool call, so overlapping checks can no longer lose each other's bookkeeping. Subagents get their own budgets — an exploration agent's searches no longer count against the main session's allowance, and vice versa. Turn boundaries come from the harness when available instead of being derived from the transcript. Fixed an issue where shell redirects such as `2>&1` were treated as package names by the dependency guard.

## 0.3.1-alpha — 2026-07-09

Doc-only: the dependency chart now shows all three setups and notes the result holds on both models, and a new diagram shows razor's five checks and the moment each one fires. No behavior change.

## 0.3.0-alpha — 2026-07-09

razor now catches a needless dependency at the moment it's written as an `import`/`require` line — not just when it's installed — and ships the lean version in the same response instead of pausing to ask. It also stops sooner when a search has already answered the question. Two new settings: `RAZOR_IMPORT_GUARD=off` and `RAZOR_SEARCH_BUDGET`.

## 0.2.10-alpha — 2026-07-08

Doc-only: Benchmarks charts now display larger (640px instead of 540px). No behavior change.

## 0.2.9-alpha — 2026-07-08

Doc-only: the cost chart now carries a "+35%" badge (what skipping razor costs on top), and the supply-chain stat gets its own chart instead of sitting only in prose. No new numbers, no behavior change.

## 0.2.8-alpha — 2026-07-08

Doc-only: the supply-chain stakes line now leads with the bigger, still-accurate cumulative figure (1.2 million malicious packages blocked to date) instead of the smaller annual one. No behavior change.

## 0.2.7-alpha — 2026-07-08

Doc-only: the README now cites real supply-chain risk data next to the dependency-avoidance chart, states plainly that every benchmark number comes from a real multi-turn agent session, and adds an honest note for tasks where razor and no plugin land in the same place. No behavior change.

## 0.2.6-alpha — 2026-07-08

Fixed the benchmarks harness's report generator so a custom `--rival-dir`/`--rival-name` arm is shown in the report table and chart instead of being silently dropped.

## 0.2.5-alpha — 2026-07-08

Doc-only: plugin.json's description now matches the marketplace listing text. No behavior change.

## 0.2.4-alpha — 2026-07-07

Doc-only: the pairing limitation noted in 0.2.3 is resolved by [hush](https://github.com/V-Songbird/hush) 0.3.6. Razor's behavior is unchanged.

## 0.2.3-alpha — 2026-07-07

Documented a known limitation when pairing razor with [hush](https://github.com/V-Songbird/hush) on hard debugging tasks. No behavior change; resolved by hush 0.3.6.

## 0.2.2-alpha — 2026-07-07

Fixed a gap in the dependency guidance: naming a new library in a request ("let's just use axios
for it") could add it via an `import`/`require` statement without ever tripping the guard, which
only watches for install commands. The guidance now covers that case too, so introducing an
undeclared dependency is flagged no matter how it's added into the code.

## 0.2.1-alpha — 2026-07-06

- Fixed unnecessary file-reading being triggered on greenfield tasks (writing into an empty
  directory) even when there was nothing to read yet.
- Fixed the guidance continuing to double-check lower-priority rules after a higher-priority one
  already applied — for example, still walking through every dependency-manifest format before
  writing a plain, dependency-free implementation. It now acts on the first applicable rule
  without further checking.

## 0.2.0-alpha — 2026-07-05

Evidence-carrying gates: deny reasons now present repo facts instead of general guidance.

- The dependency guard's deny message now lists the project's actual installed dependencies, so
  you can see at a glance what's already available before adding something new.
- Added a build ledger: razor now asks once per session if the working tree has grown unusually
  large (a lot of new files, or a lot of added code with little removed), as a nudge to check for
  unnecessary sprawl. Insertion-heavy refactors that also remove code won't trigger it. Tune with
  `RAZOR_LEDGER_LOC` / `RAZOR_LEDGER_FILES`, or disable with `RAZOR_LEDGER=off`.

## 0.1.0-alpha — 2026-07-05

Initial release. YAGNI enforcement at the harness level.

- Injects a compact "use the simplest solution that already works" checklist at the start of each
  session, and again for subagents (read-only built-ins are skipped). Tune with
  `RAZOR_AGENT_SKIP` / `RAZOR_AGENT_INJECT`.
- Dependency guard: denies the first install of a new package with a reuse-first reason; retrying
  the same install goes through. Lockfile restores and system package managers are ignored.
  Disable with `RAZOR_DEP_GUARD=off`.
- New-file meter: denies once when a single turn writes more new files than the budget (default
  4), then clears. Existing files and temp/scratchpad paths are exempt. Tune with
  `RAZOR_FILE_BUDGET`, or set to `0` to disable.
- Toggle razor on or off for the session with `/razor on|off` or "stop razor".
