# The numbers

Everything here comes from real Claude Code sessions — full conversations, not
canned replies — run on Claude Sonnet and Claude Opus, once with no plugin and
once with razor. Cost and token counts come out of the API's own usage data.
Every session is scored on the code it left behind, and correctness is checked
by running that code. **A short answer that breaks the task scores as a
failure, not a win.**

You can run all of it yourself. See [benchmarks/](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foundry/tree/main/benchmarks/razor).

> [!NOTE]
> Numbers move between runs, sometimes by a lot. These are a few hundred
> sessions against a live model, not a powered experiment. Read the direction,
> not the decimals. Where two runs disagree, this page says so.

## Does it still work?

The first question, because everything else is worthless without it.

A session is **clean** only if the code is correct *and* no package was added.
Across 156 sessions per setup, on both models:

| setup | clean sessions |
| --- | --- |
| no plugin | 146 / 156 |
| **razor** | **156 / 156** |

Widened to every session on the current build: **razor is 258 for 258**, with
zero package installs attempted. The no-plugin arm, over 240 sessions, got 10
wrong, added packages in 13, and reached for a package manager 5 times.

Every single package-manager command in the whole set came from the no-plugin
arm.

## The job razor exists for

Three of the jobs plant a throwaway phrase in the prompt — *"just use axios"*,
*"p-retry's the move"*, *"dotenv does this"*. 36 sessions per setup.

| setup | correct | package-free |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no plugin | 28 / 36 | 26 / 36 |
| **razor** | **36 / 36** | **36 / 36** |

On one of those jobs with Sonnet, plain Claude Code got it wrong **6 times out
of 6**. It took the throwaway line literally, wrote `require('axios')` into a
project that does not have axios, and the delivered code would not load.

## How much code

Lines of production code for the same job, averaged over 66 sessions per setup
per model. Test files are counted separately and are not in these figures.

| model | no plugin | razor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Opus | 18.7 | **11.6** |
| Claude Sonnet | 16.0 | **12.3** |

Across the 22 job-and-model rows, razor writes fewer lines on 20 and ties on 2.
It is never the wordiest.

It also cuts the bad days, not just the average. On Opus, the worst 10% of
no-plugin sessions run to 49 lines; razor's run to 27. Sessions that spiral past
9 tool calls: 15 out of 78 without the plugin, 3 out of 78 with it.

## Over a whole session

Every figure above is one request. This one is five, on the same codebase:
build a feature, build another, fix a bug in the second one, build two more.
Same prompts for both setups.

**Total lines of code in the project after each turn, Claude Opus:**

| after turn | no plugin | razor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 57 | **29** |
| 2 | 99 | **44** |
| 3 | 100 | **43** |
| 4 | 125 | **55** |
| 5 | **136** | **58** |

On Sonnet the same shape, smaller: 113 lines against 78.

**The gap grows.** It is 49% at turn one and 58% by turn five. And nothing
broke: **all 24 sessions passed all five features, with zero regressions in
either setup** — including turn three, the bug fix built to depend on what turn
two wrote. Smaller code was not harder to extend.

The whole five-turn conversation also cost 20% less on Opus.

## Does the shorter code do less?

The fair question, and the one we most wanted to be sure about.

We wrote 102 test cases straight from the job descriptions — before looking at
a single answer — then had a second pass strip out anything that would reward a
short answer for being short. Every test set was checked against a known-good
and a known-bad answer first, so we know they catch real mistakes.

Replayed across 240 finished sessions: **every setup passed 100% of them.**
There is not one behaviour razor's answer misses that the longer answer catches.

## In a real repository

The jobs above live in small folders. This one is a 61-file project with 8
installed packages, a real folder layout and a house convention you only see if
you look. Four jobs, 48 sessions.

| model | setup | correct | did the right thing structurally | tool calls | cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opus | no plugin | 12/12 | 12/12 | 13.6 | $0.284 |
| Opus | **razor** | **12/12** | **12/12** | **8.7** | **$0.222** |
| Sonnet | no plugin | 12/12 | 9/12 | 10.0 | $0.111 |
| Sonnet | razor | 12/12 | 9/12 | 9.3 | $0.106 |

The worry going in was that razor's "one search, then move on" would make it
duplicate a helper that already exists. **It did not.** It reused the existing
helper and the already-installed package exactly as often as plain Claude Code,
matched it on the project's naming convention, and got there on Opus with **36%
fewer tool calls for 22% less money**.

## Speed and cost

Per session, averaged over 78 sessions per setup per model.

| model | setup | turns | seconds | words written | context used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opus | no plugin | 7.5 | 29.4 | 1,772 | 147k |
| Opus | **razor** | **5.5** | **19.7** | **1,137** | **114k** |
| Sonnet | no plugin | 4.8 | 11.9 | 793 | 130k |
| Sonnet | razor | 4.4 | **11.1** | 693 | **119k** |

On a job with nothing to trim — a plain question, no code — razor's checklist
costs a few percent more and earns most of it back in a shorter answer.

## Spawned agents

When Claude splits work across five helper agents, the checklist goes to each
one. That is five copies, so it is fair to ask what it costs.

| model | setup | lines written | cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sonnet | no plugin | 44.7 | $0.216 |
| Sonnet | **razor** | **30.7** | $0.221 |
| Opus | no plugin | 32.0 | $0.464 |
| Opus | **razor** | **28.0** | $0.474 |

**About 2% more, for 13–31% less code.** The discipline survives the split, and
where splitting the work was the wrong call, both setups correctly declined to
do it.

## Where razor does not win

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are real results and they are here on purpose.

**It does not make code easier to review.** We showed 66 pairs of answers to a
blind reviewer, the same job each time, with the labels stripped and the order
swapped so position could not sway it. razor's answer was preferred **41% of
the time**, against a 60% bar we set beforehand. Its code is not measurably
flatter or less branchy per line either — the raw advantage there turns out to
be the length advantage wearing a different hat.

**The cost saving on Sonnet is not settled.** Two runs of the same jobs
disagree: one says razor is 9% cheaper, the other says it is level. Only the
Opus saving reproduces.

**The gains are smaller on Sonnet across the board.** Most of the headline
numbers on this page are Opus numbers. Sonnet moves in the same direction, less
far, and less reliably.

## Reproducing this

The harness is in [benchmarks/](https://github.com/V-Songbird/foundry/tree/main/benchmarks/razor). It drives real sessions
against the same fixed jobs, so it costs real money — the cheap default run is
about $3 on Sonnet. Start with `node runner/run.js --selftest`, which is free
and proves every scorer catches a wrong answer before you spend anything.

You will not reproduce these exact figures. If razor comes out leaner and no
pricier with correctness intact, the claim holds.
