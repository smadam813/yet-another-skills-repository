# Logic Prototype

A single, self-contained HTML file (a **shareable demo**) that lets anyone drive a state model by clicking buttons. Use it when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape**: the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once real cases run through it.

Because it is one file with nothing to install, you can hand it to a non-developer (a designer, a PM, a domain expert) and let them feel the model for themselves. So it speaks their language, not the code's.

## When this is the right shape

- "I am not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where someone wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is "what should this look like," this is the wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down the state model and the question you are prototyping. One paragraph, at the top of the demo, in a visible intro rather than a comment. A prototype that answers the wrong question is pure waste, so put the question where anyone can check it later, whether the user watches now or returns to it AFK.

### 2. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the logic that answers the question in a single `<script>` block, written as a small pure module that can lift straight into the real codebase later. The page around it is throwaway; this module is not.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer**: `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine**: explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there is no implicit current state, just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick the shape that fits the question, *not* the one that wires to a page most easily. Keep it pure: no DOM, no `document`, no button handlers reaching inside it. The page calls into the module; nothing flows the other way. That is what makes the prototype useful past its own lifetime: once the question is answered, the validated reducer / machine / function set lifts into the real module on its own.

### 3. Build the shareable HTML file

One file, plain HTML/CSS/JS: no framework, no bundler, no server, everything inline, so it opens by double-click and survives being emailed around. Anyone can run it by opening it.

Write it for a non-developer. Every label uses **domain language**, not code: buttons and state read like the business, not the reducer. Explain in plain words what is happening.

Lay it out with a clean hierarchy, top to bottom:

1. **Title and one-line explanation** of what this demo lets you explore (the question from step 1).
2. **Current state**: the full relevant state as a readable panel of labeled fields, not a raw JSON dump, re-rendered after every click so the change shows. Where it helps a non-developer follow, call out what just changed.
3. **Free-play buttons**: one button per action, always available, so anyone can poke at the model in any order. Each click dispatches its action and re-renders the state.
4. **Guided walkthroughs**: a set of **scenarios**, one per tab. Each tab holds a short plain-language description, the situation it sets up and what to watch for, and under that the ordered **buttons to press**. Each step is a real button: clicking it performs the action and moves to the next step. Starting a walkthrough resets to a known initial state, so the scenario runs the same way every time.

Choose scenarios that show the awkward cases, the ones that are hard to reason about on paper: the happy path, a tricky edge case, an attempt at something that should be illegal.

Keep it beautiful but restrained: clean typography, generous spacing, one accent color. No animations, no gimmicks, nothing that competes with the state and the buttons.

### 4. Hand it over

Send them the file, or open it for them. They will click through the walkthroughs and free-play whenever they get to it. The interesting moments are when they say "wait, that should not be possible" or "huh, I assumed X would be different"; those are the bugs in the _idea_, which is the whole point. If they want new actions or a new scenario, add them. Prototypes evolve.

### 5. Capture the answer and the prototype

Once the prototype has answered its question, capture the answer, then capture the prototype the way the [SKILL](../SKILL.md) describes. The logic-specific mapping: the validated reducer / machine / function set lifts into the real module, the decision absorbed; the HTML shell rides along to the throwaway branch that keeps the prototype as a primary source, where one self-contained file stays trivial to re-run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Do not add tests.** A prototype that needs tests is no longer a prototype.
- **Do not wire it to the real database.** Use in-memory state unless the question is about persistence.
- **Do not generalize.** No "what if we wanted to support X later." The prototype answers one question.
- **Do not blur the logic and the page together.** A pure module that references the DOM, `document`, or button handlers no longer lifts. Keep the page a thin shell over a pure module.
- **Do not reach for a framework, bundler, or server.** One file the recipient double-clicks; a React app or a dev server defeats "shareable".
- **Do not ship the HTML shell into production.** The page suits being clicked through by hand. The logic module behind it is the part worth keeping.
