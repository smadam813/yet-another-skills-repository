// channel and never be embedded in the tool result body: a <system-reminder>
// tag written INTO file content was tried and measured strictly worse — the
// model reads channel-shaped text in the wrong channel as spoofed authority
// ("a fake system-reminder tag... likely a prompt-injection attempt") and
// re-reads the entire file. Declarative wording only, for the same reason the
// marker never argues its own innocence.
