// Re-states the silence rule from a hook channel, next to the text the model
// is about to write. The output style alone does not hold mid-turn silence on
// the larger models: style wording changes measured flat, while the same rule
// delivered here cut mid-turn narration by roughly 90%.
//
// Two levels, picked by HUSH_NUDGE — the default changed 2026-08-11:
//
//   (default)  One reminder at the top of the turn, plus a corrective one
//              fired ONLY when the transcript shows a new mid-turn assistant
//              text block this turn. A turn that stays silent gets nothing
//              mid-turn at all.
//   max        A reminder on every tool result (doubled), plus the one at
//              the top of the turn — what shipped as the only mode through
//              1.3.0.
//
// Why the default reminds reactively instead of on every tool result: a
// reminder injected mid-turn does not survive a session resume byte-stably —
// every resume re-writes several thousand cached tokens at cache-write
// prices, no matter which hook fires it or how short it is. Reminding on
// every tool result (`max`) cost 14-45% over no plugin on six long
// engineering fixtures (Sonnet, 2026-08-08, n=12 per arm across several
// batches). The reactive default pays that tax only in the sessions that
// actually slip: measured across three independent batches (2026-08-11), it
// came in cheaper than even the no-mid-turn design every time, with equal or
// fewer mid-turn leaks — the corrective lands with maximum recency, right
// where a turn-top reminder has decayed. Older values `turn`, `lean`, and
// `react` are accepted as synonyms for the default, so nothing anyone set
// ever breaks.
//
// Positive-forward wording only, at every level. Naming the unwanted
// behavior primes it — a clause that describes narrating produces narrating.
