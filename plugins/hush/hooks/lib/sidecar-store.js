// Where sidecar files live, who owns them, and when they go away. One module
// because four call sites need the same answer: compress-tool-output.js writes
// them, precompact-summary.js lists this session's, session-end-cleanup.js
// removes them, and isSidecarPath decides whether a Read of one is a read of
// machine-persisted tool output.
//
// Layout: tmpdir/hush-sidecar/<session>/<content-hash>.txt — the directory IS
// the registration. Two non-.txt files share the directory: saved.json, the
// session's running compression total (see addSaved below), and hush-note, the
// once-per-session telemetry note's sentinel (see notePath below). A flat shared directory made ownership a filename prefix
// and, since files are content-addressed and an existing file is never
// rewritten, let two sessions silently share one file: whoever's cleanup ran
// first pulled the recovery location out from under the other. Per-session
// directories cost duplicated bytes when two sessions produce identical output
// and buy back a namespace that can be deleted whole.
//
// Retention is session-scoped: SessionEnd deletes this session's directory.
// Anything left behind by a crash is caught by the age-graced sweep, which
// only ever touches entries untouched for STALE_MS — a live concurrent
// session's directory has a fresh mtime (creating a file inside updates it),
// so a sweep from another session's end can't take it.
//
// Every function here is fail-open: a missing directory is a no-op, and no
// failure is worth raising into a hook.
