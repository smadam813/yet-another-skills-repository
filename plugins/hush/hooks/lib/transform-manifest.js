// the accounting is written once instead of per call site: identity (tool +
// action), input and output size, preserved and omitted line counts, recovery

// declined. Records are METADATA ONLY — counts, paths, tokens. No line of the
// output, no file content, ever lands in a record; the same rule the sidecar's
// secret screen already follows.
//
// The record is built and checked on EVERY handled tool output, gate or no
// gate: recoveryGap is a correctness check on what gets emitted, so it cannot
// depend on an env var. Only the on-disk manifest append stays behind
// HUSH_DEBUG=1 — no measured I/O cost check has been run on always-on manifest
// writing, so persisting stays opt-in.
