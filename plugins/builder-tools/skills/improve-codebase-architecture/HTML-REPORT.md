# HTML Report Format

Render the architectural review as a single self-contained HTML file in the OS temp directory. Tailwind and Mermaid both come from CDNs. Mermaid handles graph-shaped diagrams reliably. Hand-built divs and inline SVG handle the more editorial visuals, such as mass diagrams and cross-sections. Mix the two. If you lean on Mermaid for everything, the report starts to look generic.

## Scaffold

```html

    <title>Architecture review — {{repo name}}</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

      import mermaid from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs";
      mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true, theme: "neutral", securityLevel: "loose" });
    </script>
    <style>
      /* small custom layer for things Tailwind doesn't cover cleanly:
         dashed seam lines, hand-drawn-feeling arrow heads, etc. */
      .seam { stroke-dasharray: 4 4; }
      .leak { stroke: #dc2626; }
      .deep { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0f172a, #1e293b); }
    </style>

```

## Header

Repo name, date, and a compact legend: solid box = module, dashed line = seam, red arrow = leakage, thick dark box = deep module. No introduction paragraph. Go straight into the candidates.

## Candidate card

The diagrams do the work. Keep the prose sparse and plain, and use the glossary terms from the `/codebase-design` skill.

Each candidate is one `<article>`:

- **Title** — short, and it names the deepening. For example, "Collapse the Order intake pipeline".
- **Badge row** — recommendation strength (`Strong` = emerald, `Worth exploring` = amber, `Speculative` = slate), plus a tag for the dependency category (`in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, `mock`).
- **Files** — a monospaced list, `font-mono text-sm`.
- **Before / After diagram** — the centerpiece. Two columns, side by side. See the patterns below.
- **Problem** — one sentence. What hurts.
- **Solution** — one sentence. What changes.
- **Wins** — bullets, 6 words or fewer each. For example: "Tests hit one interface", "Pricing logic stops leaking", "Delete 4 shallow wrappers".
- **ADR callout** (if applicable) — one line in an amber-tinted box.

No paragraphs of explanation. If the diagram needs a paragraph before a reader understands it, redraw the diagram.

## Diagram patterns

Pick the pattern that fits the candidate. Mix them. Do not make every diagram look the same. The variety is part of the point.

### Mermaid graph (the usual choice for dependencies and call flow)

Use a Mermaid `flowchart` or `graph` when the point is "X calls Y calls Z, and look at the mess." Wrap it in a Tailwind-styled card so it matches the rest of the page. Style it with `classDef` to color leakage edges red and the deep module dark. Sequence diagrams work well for "before: 6 round-trips; after: 1."

```html
<div class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4">
  <pre class="mermaid">
    flowchart LR
      A[OrderHandler] --> B[OrderValidator]
      B --> C[OrderRepo]
      C -.leak.-> D[PricingClient]
      classDef leak stroke:#dc2626,stroke-width:2px;
      class C,D leak
  </pre>
</div>
```

### Hand-built boxes and arrows (when Mermaid's layout does not cooperate)

Draw modules as `<div>`s with borders and labels. Draw arrows as inline SVG `<line>` or `<path>` elements, positioned absolutely over a relative container. Use this when you want the "after" diagram to show one thick-bordered deep module with grayed-out internals. Mermaid will not render that with the right weight.

### Cross-section (good for layered shallowness)

Stack horizontal bands (`h-12 border-l-4`) to show the layers a call passes through. Before: 6 thin layers, each doing nothing. After: 1 thick band, labeled with the consolidated responsibility.

### Mass diagram (good for "interface as wide as implementation")

Draw two rectangles per module: one for the interface surface area, one for the implementation. Before: the interface rectangle is nearly as tall as the implementation rectangle (shallow). After: the interface rectangle is short and the implementation rectangle is tall (deep).

### Call-graph collapse

Before: a tree of function calls, drawn as nested boxes. After: the same tree collapsed into one box, with the now-internal calls shown faded inside it.

## Style guidance

- Lean editorial, not corporate dashboard. Use generous whitespace. A serif heading is optional; `font-serif` works well with stone and slate.
- Use color sparingly: one accent (emerald or indigo), plus red for leakage and amber for warnings.
- Keep diagrams around 320px tall, so before and after sit side by side without scrolling.
- Use `text-xs uppercase tracking-wider` for module labels inside diagrams. They must read as schematic, not as UI.
- The only scripts are the Tailwind CDN and the Mermaid ESM import. The report is otherwise static: no app code, and no interactivity beyond Mermaid's own rendering.

## Top recommendation section

One larger card. Candidate name, one sentence on why, and an anchor link to its card. Nothing more.

## Tone

Plain English and concise. Take the architectural nouns and verbs straight from the `/codebase-design` skill. Being concise is not an excuse to drift.

**Use exactly:** module, interface, implementation, depth, deep, shallow, seam, adapter, leverage, locality.

**Never substitute:** component, service, unit (for module) · API, signature (for interface) · boundary (for seam) · layer, wrapper (for module, when you mean module).

**Phrasings that fit the style:**

- "Order intake module is shallow — interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."

**Wins bullets** name the gain in glossary terms: *"locality: bugs concentrate in one module"*, *"leverage: one interface, N call sites"*, *"interface shrinks; implementation absorbs the wrappers"*. Do not write *"easier to maintain"* or *"cleaner code"*. Those terms are not in the glossary and they do not earn their place.

No hedging, no warm-up sentences, no "it's worth noting that…". If a sentence could be a bullet, make it a bullet. If a bullet could be cut, cut it. If a term is not in the `/codebase-design` glossary, use one that is before you invent a new one.
